Glolf is a turn-based simulated absurdist emoji two-dimensional multiplayer battle royale parody of golf. The prequel to blaseball nobody asked for, glolf is set in the alternate universe where Glolf won the Great Blaseball-Glolf Conflict and Polkadot Patterson is a five-moon driver. Hit the most balls :white_circle: into holes :golf: in the fewest strokes to win!

To get started with glolf, start a game with `g!glolf`, or check out your favorite character's stlats with `g!glolfer <name>`! For a list of commands, try `g!help commands`, or react below to continue browsing these help pages. To see everything I can teach you, try `g!help all`!

Glolf is an one-person passion project! If you want to show support I set up a ko-fi at <https://ko-fi.com/hillexed>  !

basics2 = HelpTopic("glolf basics, continued","🟩", '''
Glolf games take plase on a glolf course, represented by a grid of emojis. During a game, glolfers move around a course to try to find balls 🟠 and hit them into the holes ⛳. Here's an example glolf game:

🟩🟩:woman_kneeling:🟩🟩
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟩⛳🟩🟩🟩
🟠🟩🟩🟩🟦
:see_no_evil:🟩🟩🟦🟦
**Scorecard:**
Jasper Groove :woman_kneeling: 5 holes, 13 strokes :eyes: 
Freddie Missouri :see_no_evil: 4 holes, 8 strokes 

The most important part of a glolf game is the scorecard, at the bottom. There you can see each glolfer's name, their score, and their signature emoji (and modifications, if any, in parentheses). The player(s) in the lead will have an :eyes: emoji next to their scorecard.

Above the scorecard is the course, a 2D grid of emojis. A glolfer's position on the course will be marked by their signature emoji (the emoji next to their name on the scorecard) - so in the above example,  Jasper Groove :woman_kneeling: is near the top middle, while Freddie Missouri :see_no_evil: is in the bottom left, close to the ball 🟠 . Players can move anywhere on the course to reach the ball, and even outside of bounds.

Each turn, a glolfer can perform one action, such as moving towards a ball or hitting a ball they're standing on. The ball is always in play, even if it's out of bounds, off the screen, or in the middle of the ocean. When a glolfer hits a ball, a Hit Arrow will appear over their head :arrow_right: to tell you what direction the ball went.

Notable events, such as a glolfer scoring a ball, getting a hit, or challenging someone to a duel, will appear in a "notable events" box above the course. ''', ["basics","scoring","duels","cracks", "commands", "all"])

cracks=HelpTopic("The Fabric Of Spacetime",'💥','''
During the first Internet Open, a player named Simulacrum hit a 40-tile-long chip. Dubbed the Grand Unchip, this event weakened spacetime. Sometimes players with bad enough Grip will accidentally crack spacetime. Anything on the same tile as a rift will fall in. Don't worry! They usually make it back, falling out of another crack elsewhere onto the course.

''',['all'])

duels=HelpTopic("duels",'⚔️','''
If two glolfers are on the same tile, they might challenge one another to a Duel! The :crossed_swords: emoji represents a duel in progress on the glolf course.

Each glolfer uses different dueling techniques, and might be more or less effective against other duelers. A glolfer's Self-Awareness and Stance stlats determine how good they are at dueling. Watch for their Signature Move!

When a glolfer wins a duel, they'll launch the other glolfer into the air! They'll land in the farthest hole, allowing the winner of the duel the chance to score. Of course, that's not be the only way a duel can end...
''', ["basics2"])

scorenames=HelpTopic("scorenames",'📛','''
There are different names for scores depending on how many strokes a ball recieves before reaching a hole. Each course has a "par" - a number that measures how many strokes a Competent Player should be able to score the ball using. A "hole in one" is hitting a ball into a hole in one stroke. Here are some other common score names:

4 below par: "Condor"
3 below par: "Albatross"
2 Below par: "Eagle"
1.5 below par: "||------||"
1 below par: "Birdie"
0.5 below par: "||----||"
0 below par: "Par". yup
0.5 above par: ||------||
1 above par: "Bogey"
1.5 above par: ||--------||
2 above par: "Double Bogey"
1.5 above par: ||---------||
3 above par: "Triple Bogey"
3.14 above par: ||--------||
10 above par: "Disappointment"

Making an Eagle will summon the Eagle, and making an Albatross will summon the Albatross.

''', ["basics2"])

scoring=HelpTopic("scoring",'🎊','''
Glolf scoring is similar to golf scoring. In glolf, the player who has hit the most balls into holes wins. (This is technically true in golf too, but glolfers don't have time to wait for their opponents to finish the course). If two glolfers score the same number of balls, the player with the least strokes wins (like golf).

Taking Posession of other players' balls is perfectly legal.

After a player scores in a club game, they must hand off the club to a teammate. Their teammate will drive onto the field in a glolf cart 🛺 to tag in! No guarantees they won't ram anybody, though...
